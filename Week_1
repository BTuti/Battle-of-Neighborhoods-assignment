Description of the Problem:-
India is the second most populous country in the world .It has a lot of urban centers. As per the last census, which was conducted in 2011,  the total number of million plus cities was 42. India has a lot of diversity .It has at least 9 recognized Religions and 22 Official Languages. In such a diverse country, food habits also change with region.
Traditionally, Indians had the lowest rate of meat consumption in the world. It still has over 500 Millions vegetarians. Most restaurants in India clearly distinguish and market themselves as being ‘Non_vegetarian” or ”Vegetarian”. Vegetarianism in India is synonymous with “Lacto_vegetarianism”. Animal based ingredients, except honey and milk , are generally avoided in traditional cuisines . Now a days , high-end Vegan Restaurants are also coming up  in the cities.
In this project,  we would try to find the top 10 Indian cities which have the presence of pure high-end “Vegan/Vegetarian Restaurants”.
Description of the data:-
We will use two datasets to arrive at a solution.
1)	Dataset on the Indian cities (https://www.downloadexcelfiles.com/wo_en/download-excel-file-list-cities-towns-india#.XstsSGgzZPY). It has the details of the 1214 Indian cities and their population as per 2011 census.
2)	Foursquare API will be used to fetch other relevant information to complete the task.
Plan:
First of all Latitude /Longitude of Indian cities will be fetched using  'Nominatim' API. Thereafter, all the venues in the radius of 25 Km will be fetched using 'Foursquare API'. The data will be grouped using 'Groupby'method and filtered using the keyword 'Vegan/ Vegetarianism'.
